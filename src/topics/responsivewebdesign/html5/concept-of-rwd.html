                As the Web matures, the devices that provide access to it have evolved along with it. Today, we are not just limited to Desktop&#146;s for accessing information on the web; The web-enabled devices have evolved from computers, laptops to hand-held smart phones, tablets, Iphone, Ipad, e-book readers like the Kindle, and more.
            </p>
            <p>	
                We&#146;re now faced with a browser landscape that&#146;s become increasingly untethered from the desktop, with devices becoming smaller and larger simultaneously. Small-screen devices are estimated to become the dominant form of web access in a matter of years, while modern game consoles have made a widescreen, television-centric web more readily accessible. Tablet computing has become wildly popular of late, presenting us with a mode of web access that is neither fully &quot;mobile&quot; nor &quot;desktop,&quot; but somewhere in between.
             </p>
             <p>
                 The long and short of it is that we&#146;re designing for more devices, more input types, and more resolutions than ever before. The web has moved beyond the desktop, and it&#146;s not turning back. In the current situation, designing websites targeting the web audience can be quite a challenge. 
             </p>
             <p>
                 With more devices, come varying screen resolutions, definitions and orientations. New devices with new screen sizes are being developed every day, and each of these devices may be able to handle variations in size, functionality and even color. Some are in landscape, others in portrait, still others even completely square. As we know from the rising popularity of the iPhone, iPad and advanced smartphones, many new devices are able to switch from portrait to landscape at the user&#146;s whim.
             </p>
             <p>
                 In the field of Web design and development, we&#146;re quickly getting to the point of being unable to keep up with the endless new resolutions and devices. For many websites, creating a website version for each resolution and new device would be impossible, or at least impractical. Should we just suffer the consequences of losing visitors from one device, for the benefit of gaining visitors from another? 
             </p>
             <p>
                 Responsive Web design is the solution and the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user&#146;s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Day by day, the number of devices, platforms, and browsers that need to work with your site grows. 
                 Responsive web design represents a fundamental shift in how we&#146;ll build websites for the decade to come.

                 Looking at the usage trend, we find that high resolution desktop screens are being adopted quickly. 1280px screen lead the pack, but have a decreasing usage trend and in the near-future we could start considering 1360px wide screen as the ideal desktop screen. This could go-on & we might end with even higher screen resolutions as the common screen resolution.
             </p>
             <p>
                 The future of fixed width layouts is questionable and fluid layouts will have to be the clear winner in this scenario. The practice of responsive web design is a blend of fluid layouts and media queries.
